# something-fish-related
A simple fishing-based video game for a Computer Graphics class.

## Update: This repo has since been archived due to the class coming to a close.
Some cool things to actually implement are the following:
* Functionality for actually catching a fish. Currently, fish cannot be caught
* A minigame to actually catch the fish, like maybe something similar to catching fish in Sea Of Thieves
* Different maps that can be bough through an in game store
* An in game store for new maps (with their own more valuable fish) and cosmetic items. Coins can be obtained by catching the fish. The more difficult the fish, the more coins it yields.
* Bait for sale in the shop
* Graphics features: fish jumping out of water, splashes, precedural waves and clouds, bubbles, etc.
